# SPHY model interface plugin for QGIS
<i>Version 1.0.0</i>

This interface is developed as plugin for QGIS, and is currently only compatible with SPHY version 2.0. This first version of the interface has been developed to be used in snow- and glacier-fed river basins. Therefore, the use of this interface is less suitable for other applications. Ongoing development will make the interface suitable to be used with more recent versions of SPHY and a broader range of hydrological applications.   

<b>Minimum system requirements</b>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 or later version</li>
<li>QGIS 2.4 or later version (32 bits is mandatory)</li>
</ul>

<b>SPHY model user group</b></br>
A user group for the SPHY model is available in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sphy-model-user" target="_blank">Google Groups</a>. You can use this group to post Questions and Answers related to the source code, available plugins, input and output formats, calibration, applications, and suggestions for improvements.
